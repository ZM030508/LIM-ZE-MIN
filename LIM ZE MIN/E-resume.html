          <p>Playing golf is one of my favorite hobby. I play this game daily and enjoy it a lot . I started playing golf when I was 5 years old with my two elder brothers in the garden of my house.
          <br>
          <br>
          My favorite golfer is (Tiger Woods). He is one of the best players in the world. I want to be like him in the future.
          <br>
          <br>
          My parents have often told me that, do not play golf today, but I play it daily because it is one of my passions and I play this game with the core of my heart. It makes me feel proud of what I am.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also won many prizes in the battle of golf. I also received many invitations to play. And I am the best player in my whole team and also a captain, maybe because I play this game seriously. I am a All rounder  player in my team, but good at balling as compared to the batting. I also got the credit of the man of the match in my school tournament. My highest batting score is (your highest score), and the highest numbers of wickets which I got till now are (highest number of wickets in a match).
          <br>
          <br>
          My skills in golf are growing day by day and in the future, I want to continue this interesting game as my career. Although I also study hard, day and night but golf is my love.
          <br>
          <br>
          I love to play golft and this my hobby too.</p>

          <p>The family is a valuable god gift which plays a most crucial role in every individual’s life. I love my family very much because all of my family members stand in my good as well as bad times. From moral teachings to love and support, my family has always helped me without any demand. There is no doubt that we experience our biggest triumphs when we really connect to them.
          <br>
          <br>
          My family is like a strong pillar for me, on which I can rely blindly anytime I require support. From my family, I have learned the social graces of loyalty & cooperation.
          <br>
          <br>
          My family consists of my grandfather, my grandmother, my mother, my father, one young sisters and myself. My grandparents are the pillars of my family and my grandfather is the head of my family. He is the one whose decision relating to any matter is final and all of us do respect it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Right from my childhood, my family members have prepared me for the challenges that I’ll face in the years ahead. In addition to this, all of my family members help and serve each other at times of need. These qualities that I have learnt from my family has helped me to shape my adult life in a right manner.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am really very attached to my grandfather. He holds an excellent life experience because he has already faced so many ups and downs. My Grandfather has helped me to build my perception & vision towards society.
          <br>
          <br>
          My family has always been there to motivate and encourage me to overcome all difficulties in life and achieve success. The role of every member in my family is unique and important in their own way. I thank God that I have grown up in a family full of love and discipline. My family values will definitely help me in becoming a better person.</P>
